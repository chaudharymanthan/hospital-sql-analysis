# hospital-sql-analysis
This is a simple SQL project based on hospital data analysis. In this project, I used SQL queries to find total patients, average doctors, medical expenses, longest hospital stay, and patient details by city. It shows basic SQL concepts like SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and date functions.
